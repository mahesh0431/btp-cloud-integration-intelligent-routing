# Route multi-region traffic to SAP BTP services intelligently 

## Description

Critical business use cases built on SAP BTP need to be highly available and responsive. While availability zones help with disruptions in a single region, application developers and administrators are responsible for availability and stability in cases of regional outage or application upgrades. This scenario demonstrates techniques for load balancing, failover, and latency reduction of BTP services, such as SAP Launchpad and SAP Cloud Integration, with Hyperscaler traffic management solutions like Azure Traffic Manager.

### Challenge

A lack of automatic failover, especially for critical business scenarios, can be damaging to your business. If users are located in diverse geographies, latency will also increase if services are restored in a single region.

### Solution

Use your own domain for SAP BTP services, extensions, and integrations endpoints using the SAP Custom Domain Service. Configure Hyperscaler traffic management solutions such as Azure Traffic Manager and apply different profiles to decouple connection information.

### Outcome

A cloud-native integration pattern that incorporates SAP BTP and Hyperscaler services eliminates downtime, reduces global latency, and increases throughput.

### Implementations

#### [Intelligent Routing for SAP Cloud Integration using Azure Traffic Manager](https://github.tools.sap/SAP-samples/btp-services-intelligent-routing/tree/cloudintegration_azure)

In this scenario, you will learn how to achieve the high availability of a Cloud Integration flow built by a customer using SAP Custom Domain service & Azure traffic manager. 

#### [High Availability of SAP Launchpad service on SAP Business Technology Platform using Azure Traffic Manager](https://github.tools.sap/SAP-samples/btp-services-intelligent-routing/tree/launchpad_azure)

This scenario will be similar to the above one, but here we will achieve the high availability of the SAP Launchpad service, a SaaS application managed by SAP.
